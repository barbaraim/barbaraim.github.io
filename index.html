    <h1>Bárbara Irarrázaval Montes</h1>

    <p>Software Engineering student at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, pursuing an Industrial Engineering degree. 
      
     </p>

    <p>I am very interested in web design, specially in front-end web development. During the last years, I have had the opportunity to learn many technologies and languages that helped me with my passions, including ReactJS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails and Python. </p>
  <p> Learning and thinking more and creative ways of solving today's problems through technology is something I value. I believe that through collaboration and thinking outside of the box, we can achieve great solutions. </p>
